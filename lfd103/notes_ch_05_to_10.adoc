== 05. Configuring your Development system

=== Setting up system packages

Install the following packages: `build-essential`, `vim`, `git`, `cscope`, `libncurses-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `bison`, `flex`, and `git-email`.


=== Setting up `git email`

To configuring `git email` to send patches:
----
git config sendemail.smtpserver <url>
git config sendemail.smtpserverport <port_nb>
git config sendemail.smtpencryption <encryption_type>
git config sendemail.smtpuser <username>
git config sendemail.smtppass <password>
----
Few common values are:

* `<url>`: smtp.gmail.com
* `<port_nb>`: 587
* `<encryption_type>`: tls

To send patch via email:
----
git send-email <patch_file>
----
[CAUTION]
====
If you have enabled 2-factor authentication on your email account, you may see a failure:

----
ERROR: STARTTLS failed! SSL connect attempt failed error:1416F086:SSL
----

Whenever 2-factor authentication is enabled, you'll need to generate an app specific password for authentication.
Hence, to generate a password for using git, you can refer to *EXAMPLES* section https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email[here].
====


[IMPORTANT]
====
Instead of git, if you are using your email client to send the patches, make sure that in your mailing process to:

* Turn off html encoding and send plain ASCII text
* Turn off any line-wrapping or flowing
* Send your patch directly in the email message instead of as an attachment
* Don't write your signature or any other personal information
====

=== Setting up email client

Even if you use `git` to send patches, you'll still have to configure your email client to communicate with community.

Configuring email client:

* Disable HTML format, don't use it for any communication
+
[CAUTION]
====
Messages with html in it are automatically discarded
====
* Disable signature
* Never write your message above the original text while responding to an email.
Always write it at the bottom of the original text, in other words configure your client to 'bottom post'.


[IMPORTANT]
====

* Other than sharing kernel logs, and configuration files while reporting bugs, don't send any attachments in any communications.

* Follow inline posting i.e. when reviewing or responding to a patch, delete the parts of the message that you are not replying to.
====

== 06. Exploring Linux Kernel sources

It is recommended that you create a separate folder for downloading and working on kernel code instead of doing it at the root of the `HOME`.

All latest stable and mainline releases are on the https://www.kernel.org/[kernel archives] page

You can clone Linus's tree at:
`git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git`

Take a look at the files, and directories.
You'll notice that bulk of code lives in `drivers` subdirectory.

Take a look at the `Makefile` and `MAINTAINERS` files at the root of the directory.
Take a look at the scripts that you'll be using every day as kernel developer: `scripts/get_maintainer.pl`, and `scripts/checkpatch.pl`.

Use `git log` to see the history.
Note down an individual commit, and generate a patch to reach this commit from the previous one using:
----
git format-patch -1 <commit_id>
----

Clone the `linux-kselftest` repository at:
`git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shuah/linux-kselftest.git`

Check the branches underneath it and checkout the `next` branch.


== 07. Building and Installing your first kernel

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following steps are not specific to `stable` kernel release.
You can play with any kernel release in the kernel tree using the same procedure.
Here, `stable` is chosen just to make sure that you don't face any unforeseen issues.
====

* Clone the stable kernel git at:
`git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git`

* This has branches going as far back as version 2.6.11.
Find the latest branch and switch to it.

* Copy the latest kernel configuration file at `/boot/config-x.y.z-N-generic` of your system to `.config` folder of your branch to either use it as it is or as a starting point to generate a new configuration file to compile the new kernel.

* Sometimes new releases of kernel introduce new configuration variables, and in some cases, rename the configuration symbols(which can cause compilation errors).
Hence, run:
+
----
make listnewconfig
----
to see list of new configuration symbols.

* If you want to simply use the current configuration file that you copied as the configuration file, then you can skip this step.
+
If you want to generate a new config file based on the current configuration file that you copied:
+
----
make oldconfig
----
+
You'll be prompted with `[Y/N]` to tune the configuration to enable new features and drivers.
You can just press `Enter` to select the default for all of them.

** Alternatively, you can also create a config file that will trim down the kernel and tailor it to your system:
+
----
lsmod > /tmp/my-lsmod
make LSMOD=/tmp/my-lsmod localmodconfig
----
+
This will create a configuration file based on modules that are currently loaded on your system.
Hence, the generated kernel will be trimmed down and tailored to your system.

* To compile the kernel, you can just do:
+
----
make all
----
+
Option `j<N>` can be used to specify the `<N>` number of `make` jobs to run simultaneously to compile the kernel faster.
+
Here, you simply use the configuration file you copied as the configuration and compile the kernel.
But instead if you want to generate a new kernel configuration file, a separate step needs to be executed before compiling kernel:


* Install new kernel:
+
----
su -c "make modules_install install"
----
+
this will install the new kernel and run `update-grub` to add the new kernel to the grub menu.

* Save logs from current kernel to compare and look for regression and new errors.
+
----
dmesg -t > dmesg_current
dmesg -t -k > dmesg_kernel
dmesg -t -l <level> > dmesg_current_<level>
----
+
|====
|Option |Argument |Usage

|`t`
|
|generate logs without timestamps to it easier to compare the old, and the new

|`k`
|
|outputs only kernel messages

|`l`
| `<level>` which can be `emerg`, `alert`, `crit`, `err`, `warn`, and `info`.
|generate logs of a particular level
|====
+
Files `dmesg_current_<level>` should be empty, otherwise it can indicate some hardware/kernel problem.

* Check for secure boot.
+
If it is enabled, then you cannot boot the new kernel as it is unsigned.
+
[NOTE]
====
If `dmesg_current` is empty, secure boot might be enabled in your system.
====
+
You can temporarily disable secure boot with MOK manager using `mokutil`.
+
** To check secure boot status:
+
----
mokutil --sb-state
----

** If you see:
+
----
SecureBoot disabled
Platform is in Setup Mode
----
+
you are all set to boot up.
Otherwise, if you see:
+
----
SecureBoot enabled
SecureBoot validation is disabled in shim
----
+
Then you'll need to disable it:
+
----
mokutil --disable-validation
----
+
When prompted enter mok password which normally is `12345678` and answer `Yes` to disable the secure boot
+
[NOTE]
====
After finishing everything and when you no longer want to boot the installed kernel.
You can re-enable secure boot:

----
mokutil --enable-validation
----
then do as before with the prompt.

For more https://askubuntu.com/questions/1119734/how-to-replace-or-remove-kernel-with-signed-kernels[info].
====

* Before booting, lets me sure that we have the option to boot into something if in case the new kernel doesn't boot.
+
The `GRUB` automatically takes the newly installed kernel as the default, hence, we will need to change that to a prompt which provide us an option to select the kernel.
+
To change grub configuration:

** go to the file `/etc/default/grub`:
*** Uncomment `GRUB_TIMEOUT` and set it to 10: `GRUB_TIMEOUT=10`
*** Comment out `GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden`
*** Enable `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="earlyprintk=vga"` to print early boot messages to figure out why the kernel failed to boot.
** update grub configuration:
+
----
update-grub
----

* You can reboot the system:
+
----
reboot
----

* On the prompt choose the new kernel

* If it doesn't boot, reboot and go back to old kernel to investigate.
If it boots well, verify the new installation:
** Collect the `dmesg` logs as before
** Do a diff to see if there are any regressions

== 08. Writing your First Kernel patch

* Configure your git:
Use the command in the following format
+
----
git config.<section> <option> <value>
----
+
To configure:
** `user` section with fields `name` and `email`
** `format` section with field `signoff=true`
** `sendemail` section with email configuration

* Clone the mainline kernel again or do a rebase to pick up new changes since the last time you cloned the repository
** Add a remote repo, setting it to name `linux`, to say where to take the changes from
+
----
git remote add linux git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
----
** Pick up the changes:
+
----
git fetch linux
----

* Create a new branch and switch to it

* Make your changes

* Compile the code:
+
----
make -j<N> all
----
+
Fix errors, if any and recompile

* Check if your changes match the https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html[linux kernel coding style]:
+
----
git diff > temp
scripts/checkpatch.pl temp
rm temp
----
+
Fix errors, if any and recompile

* Commit with a sign-off, and a message.
+
[NOTE]
====
Guidelines to write a proper commit message:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* In the subject line, use the imperative mood(meaning spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction)
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
====
+
[TIP]
====
Hooks are actions that are performed before and/or after a command is executed.
Git has both pre- and post-commit hooks.
You can set it up to automate the process of checking the patch.
If you see any errors, you can fix it, and then you can amend the commit:

----
git commit --amend
----

====

* Generate a patch file

=== Kernel configuration

Linux kernel is completely configurable.
Drivers also known as modules(files with extension `ko`) can be configured to be:

* disabled
* built into the kernel image(`vmlinuz`), and be loaded at boot time
* built as a module to be loaded as needed(for example, when a matching hardware is detected) using `modprobe`
+
[NOTE]
====
This is a better approach to keep the size of the kernel small
====

[NOTE]
====
Modules that can be configured in any of the 3 options, is called a tristate driver.
====


=== Making changes to a driver
* Pick a driver to change:
+
pick one from the list the current drivers/modules loaded on your system:
----
lsmod
----

* Find all the relevant files for the driver in the repository:
+
search in `Makefiles` using:
+
----
git grep <module_name> -- '*Makefile'
----

* Now navigate to the driver folder, and find a file with probe function which has a name that ends with string `_probe`

* In the probe function add:
+
----
pr_info("<op_message>")
----
+
This `<op_message>` string will be visible in `dmesg`.

* To test the change:
** Configure in the makefile `CONFIG_<name>=y`
** Recompile your kernel and install.
** Load your module
*** To test as a loadable module
**** Load the module
+
----
modprobe <module_name>
----
*** To test as built-in module:
+
----
reboot
----
** Check the kernel buffer message
+
----
dmesg | grep <op_message>
----
** Unload your module
+
----
modprobe <module_name>
----

Lets pick USB Video Class(UVC) media driver as an example.
Then, its `Makefile` is `drivers/media/usb/uvc/Makefile`.
Code is at `drivers/media/usb/uvc/`.
Its modprobe function is name `uvc_probe` located in `drivers/media/usb/uvc/uvc_driver.c`.
Its configuration option is `CONFIG_USB_VIDEO_CLASS`.
Its module name is `uvcvideo`.

== 09. Getting your patch ready to send

To know who to send the patch to:
----
get_maintainer.pl <changed_source_code_file>
----
Do this to all your files to get the list of maintainers, commit signers, supporters and all the mailing list to which you'll need to send your patch to.

Now generate a patch with email encoded in it:
----
git format-patch -1 <commit_id> --to=<email_id_x> --to=<email_id_y> --cc=<email_id_p> --cc=<email_id_q>
----
The mailing lists should be on the `cc` and the rest are on `to`.

Now, to send the generated patch:
----
git send-email <patch_with_email_encoded_in_it>
----

[NOTE]
====
Sometimes you need to send multiple related patches.
In such a case you can create a threaded patch series that includes the top `<N>` commits and generated cover letter template:

----
git format-patch -<N> -s --cover-letter --thread --subject-prefix="PATCH v<N>" --to=<email_id> --cc=<email_id>
----
It is a good practice to send a cover letter when sending a patch series.
====


=== Review process
Patches will get comments from reviewers with suggestions for improvements.
Always thank the reviewers and don't hesitate to ask a clarifying question about their comments.

[NOTE]
====
Be patient and wait for a week before requesting a response.
During merge windows it may take more time.
After which you can send a gentle message.
====

When a patch is reworked, it is important to include patch history showing changes between `---` and the `start of the diff` lines of the patch file.
This doesn't get added to the commit, but it helps the reviewer and saves his time.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Don't include the patch history in the commit messages
====

Don't send new version of patch as a reply to an older version.
Start a new thread for each version.


=== Additional guidelines for sending patches
* While documenting your change, include the tests you executed and their results
* `Signed-off` should be the last tag
* Don't forget to use the right tags to credit people: `Suggested-by`, `Reported-by`, and `Tested-by` etc.
* If you disagree with a review, respectfully state the reasons for it, along with the supporting technical data.
* You may get comments any time during the review process
* After the patch gets accepted into `linux-next` for integration into the mainline, Kernel build and Continuous Integration (CI) bots are used to test.
Stay engaged and be ready to fix problems, if any.
* Including patch series version history in the cover letter will help reviewers get a quick snapshot of changes

== 10. Compiling a single source
To compile the whole project takes a lot of time.
Instead, you first try to compile a single file or a directory:
----
make <path>
----

To compile a single module(driver):
----
make M=<module_path>
----

Until all dependencies are enabled, a driver you are looking to enable will not be enabled.
To manage dependencies:

* By hand

** Find the dependencies, read the `<module_path>/Kconfig` file to identify the line:
+
----
config <module_var_name>
...
depends on <variables>
select <variables>
...
----
+
variables in `select` lines are auto-selected.
variables in the line with text `depends on`, are dependencies that need to be enabled.

** To enable one, you'll need to do:
+
----
CONFIG_<variable_name>=<value>
----
+
in the `Makefile`.

* By tool:
+
----
make menuconfig
----
+
at the root of the project directory.


For example, `vimc` module's directory `drivers/media/test-drivers/vimc/` can be used as a `<path>` or `<module_path>` in the above commands.

To modify by hand:

* Its dependencies can be found at `drivers/media/test-drivers/vimc/Kconfig`.
* `VIDEO_DEV`, `VIDEO_V4L2`, `VIDEO_V4L2_SUBDEV_API` are its dependencies while `VIDEOBUF2_VMALLOC` and `VIDEO_V4L2_TPG` get auto-selected.
* We can set `CONFIG_VIDEO_VIMC` value to:

** `m` for enabling it as a module
** `y` for built-in module
** `n` for disabling the module

If modify using `menuconfig` tool, go to `/Device Drivers/Multimedia support/Media test drivers/vimc` in the hierarchy and follow the instructions displayed to modify the variables as shown in the figure:
