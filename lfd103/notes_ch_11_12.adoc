== 11. All about testing

The further down the lane a bug is discovered, more time, effort, and cost will be incurred to fix it.
Hence, Automated build bots and Continuous Integration (CI) test rings are vital to ensure code works on existing environment(hardware etc.) as well as new ones.

CI rings are test farms that run boot tests and Kernel self-tests on `stable`, `linux-next`, and `mainline` trees on real hardware, as well as Qemu environments, covering a wide range of architectures and configurations.

In OSS developers and user share the responsibility of testing.
Testers need not be developers, in fact, the more someone is not familiar with code the more effective they are as a tester.

Developer testing, integration testing, regression, and stress testing have different individual goals.

=== Apply patches
You can apply patches via `Patch` tool or `git`.
----
git clean -dfx
git reset --hard
patch -p1 < <patch_file>
----
or
----
git apply --index <patch_file>
----

=== Basic Testing
Run a few usage test:

* Is networking (Wi-Fi or wired) functional?
* Does `ssh` work?
* Run `rsync` of a large file over `ssh`
* Run `git clone` and `git pull`
* Start a web browser
* Read email
* Download files over `ftp`, `wget`, etc.
* Play audio/video files
* Connect new USB devices - mouse, USB stick, etc.

=== Examine kernel logs
[source, bash]
----
include::rsrcs/refex/dmesg_cur.sh[]
----

[CAUTION]
====
If there are any stack traces resulting from `WARN_ON` in the dmesg, it indicates serious problems that require further investigation.
====

=== Stress Testing

For a good overall stress test, you can:

* Download 3-4 linux kernel gits
* Run timed compile of all them in parallel:
+
----
time make all
----

=== Debug options and Proactive testing

Enable the following options:

* `CONFIG_KASAN`
* `CONFIG_KMSAN`
* `CONFIG_UBSAN`
* `CONFIG_LOCKDEP`
* `CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING`
* `CONFIG_LOCKUP_DETECTOR`

These options help to test for locking imbalances, deadlines, memory leaks etc.

To find debug configuration options:
----
git grep -r DEBUG | grep Kconfig
----

== 12. Debugging Basics
Debugging is an art, and not a science.
There is no step-by-step procedure or a single recipe for success when debugging a problem.

Some questions to consider before deciding a debugging strategy:

* Is the problem easily reproducible?
+
If yes it can be easier to debug and fix
* Is there a reproducer or test that can trigger the bug consistently?
* Are there any panic, or error, or debug messages in the dmesg when the bug is triggered?
* Is reproducing the problem time-sensitive?
+
If yes, it can be a result of race-conditions which is harder to debug, and fix

[TIP]
====
https://cregit.linuxsources.org/[Cregit] is a great tool to see the history of changes.
You can use it to see http://www.gonehiking.org/ShuahLinuxBlogs/blog/2018/10/18/who-made-that-change-and-when-using-cregit-for-debugging/[who made a change and when].

=== Panic Message
The following two blogs are good resources to refer to:

* https://sanjeev1sharma.wordpress.com/tag/debug-kernel-panics/[Debugging Analysis of Kernel panics and Kernel oopses using System Map]
* https://www.opensourceforu.com/2011/01/understanding-a-kernel-oops/[Understanding a Kernel Oops!]

==== Decode and Analyze Panic Message

Panic messages can be analyzed using `decode_stacktrace.sh` tool.

[TIP]
====
Refer to https://lwn.net/Articles/592724/[article] to know how to use the `decode_stacktrace.sh` tool
====

* Save (cut and paste) the panic trace in the `dmesg` between the two following lines of text into a `.txt` file:
+
----
------------[ cut here ]------------
<panic_trace>
---[ end trace â€¦. ]---
----

* Run the tool:
+
----
scripts/decode_stacktrace.sh <vmlinux> <base_path> <modules_path> < <panic_trace>.txt
----
+
`<vmlinux>` is the location of the `/vmlinux` directory
`<base_path>` is the root of the git repo where `<vmlinux>` is present which can be dropped if you are running the tool from the root of the repo.
If the panic is created by a dynamically loaded kernel module, you need to give the path of the module as `<module_path>`.

=== Use Event Tracing to Debug
[WARNING]
====
For time-sensitive problems, avoid enabling additional messages and event tracing as it can change the timing and make it harder to reproduce the problem
====

Event tracing can be a valuable tool in debugging.

To see the list of available events that you can enable:
----
less /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_events
----

To enable all the events:
----
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/enable
----
0 can be written to disable.

To enable an event related to a particular kernel area
----
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/<kernel_area>/enable
----

Before you run the reproducer, you can determine the areas of interest based on the call trace and then enable the relevant event traces.

[TIP]
====
You can use `pr_debug` and `dev_debug` to add debug messages which can be used to gather information on a bug.
