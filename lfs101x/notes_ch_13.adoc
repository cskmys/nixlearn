== Chapter 13: Manipulating Text
All the configuration files, scripts etc. are simple text files.
Hence, manipulating text is important.

=== Output commands
==== `cat`
Advanced usage:

|====
|Command |Usage

|`cat <file_name_1> <file_name_2> <file_name_n>`
|Concatenate contents of multiple files in the order that they are written and print it

|`cat <file_name_1> <file_name_2> > <op_file>`
|Combine multiple files and print it(save) to a new file

|`cat <file_name_1> >> <file_name_2>`
|Append contents of the file `<file_name_1>` to the end of the file `<file_name_2>`

|`cat > <file_name>`
|Any subsequent lines typed will go into the file `<file_name>`, until `Ctrl-D` is pressed

|`cat >> <file_name>`
|Any subsequent lines are appended to the file `<file_name>`, until `Ctrl-D` is pressed

|`cat > <file_name> << EOF` or `cat << EOF > <file_name>`
Any subsequent lines typed will go into the file `<file_name>`, until string `EOF` or `STOP` is typed at the beginning of a new line following which `enter` key is pressed
|====

==== `echo`
Advanced usage:

|====
|Command |Usage

|`echo -e <string> > <op_file>`
|Take the string `<string>` and print it(save) to a new file.
Option `e` enables use of special character sequences such as `\n` for new line and `\t` for tab etc.

|`echo -e <string> >> <file_name>`
|Append the string `<string>` to the end of the file `<file_name>`

|`echo > <file_name>`
|Same as `touch <file_name>`

|`echo $<env_var>`
|View value of environment variable

|====

=== Working with large files
==== Normal files
[NOTE]
====
`man` internally uses `less`
====

Advanced usage:

|====
|Command |Usage

|`cat <file_name_1> <file_name_2> <file_name_n> \| less`
|Concatenate contents of multiple files in the order that they are written and print it with paging/scrolling abilities

|`tail -f <file_name>`
|Option `f` will cause `tail` to continuously display any new lines in <file_name> as soon as that get added.
Mostly used to monitor activity, log files etc.
|====

==== Compressed files
For compressed files you cannot use the regular commands.
The common utilities for regular files:

* `cat`
* `less`
* `more`
* `grep`
* `diff`

have their counterparts that work with compressed files, which have the same name but prefixed with:
|====
|Prefix |Compression type

|`z`
|gz

|`bz`
|bzip2

|`xz`
|xz
|====

Hence, for gz compression we have `zcat`, `zless`. `zmore`, `zgrep`, and `zdiff`.
