== Chapter 8: Finding Linux Documentation

Linux is very vast, and we may not always know or remember the proper use of commands and utilities.
Hence, we will need to consult help documentation regularly.

In most cases, the documentation is well-made and well-organized, but sometimes it can be lacking in depth or clarity.
In such cases, due to the open nature of linux, it is easy to find support online.

=== Sources
Linux draws from various sources and hence there are various sources for documentation as well.

=== The `man` pages
The manual pages present in all linux distributions provide in-depth documentation about programs, utilities, configuration files, system call APIs, library routines, and the kernel.
They can be accessed using `man` command:
----
man <topic_name>
----
But, any given topic might have multiple pages associated with it.
To see available pages specific to the topic:
----
man -f <topic_name>
----
or
----
whatis <topic_name>
----

To list all pages that have a particular topic name in their name/description:
----
man -k <topic_name>
----
or
----
apropos <topic_name>
----

Each man page can have multiple chapters numbered 1-9, and a specific chapter can be accessed by:
----
man <ch_nb> <topic_name>
----
